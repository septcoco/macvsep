## üöÄ Download the Alpha

The easiest way to use MacVSep is to download the latest pre-compiled version.

1.  Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/septcoco/macvsep/releases).
2.  Under the latest release, download the `MacVSep.app.zip` file.
3.  Unzip the file, and you will have `MacVSep.app`. Drag it to your Applications folder.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Here are some of the features and improvements planned for future versions:

#### Core Functionality
*   [x] **Persistent Output Location:** Remember the last used output folder between app launches.
*   [x] **Favorite Models:** Allow users to mark models as favorites to pin them to the top of the list.
*   [x] **Local History:** Keep a history of past separation jobs, which automatically clears after 72 hours (to match Mvsep's server retention).
*   [x] **Official API History:** Upgrade the History feature to use the official `GET /api/app/separation_history` endpoint. This will provide authoritative server-side history, including `job_exists`, `credits_used`, and `time_left` information.
*   [ ] **Batch Processing:** Allow users to queue up multiple files for separation. (Requires a "Premium Account" setting to handle job limits).
*   [ ] **Expanded Output Formats (via FFmpeg)**
*   [x] **Cancel Button**

#### UI & User Experience
*   [x] **Improved File Input:** Allow users to also click the drop zone to open a file selection dialog.
*   [ ] **Model Leaderboard/Usage Stats:** Display a list of popular or most-used models (potentially based on community data or user's own usage).
*   [ ] **Enhanced UI/UX:** General improvements to the visual design and user flow.
*   [x] **Background Customization:** Add options in Settings to change the app's background gradient.

#### Community & Project
*   [ ] **Community:**
    *   [ ] Create a Discord server for community discussion and support.
*   [x] **Move to Beta:** Once the core features are stable and polished.
*   [ ] **Official `v1.0.0` Release!**

## ü§î Considered Features

This is a list of features that have been requested but will not be implemented, along with the reasoning.

*   **Real-time percentage progress:** The Mvsep API only reports the status as `waiting`, `processing`, or `done`. It does not provide a percentage value, making this feature impossible for us to implement, unless ZFTurbo implements it, which is highly unlikely.

## üêû Feedback & Bugs

This is an early alpha release. If you find any bugs or have suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/septcoco/macvsep/issues) on GitHub!
